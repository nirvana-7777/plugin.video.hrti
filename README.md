## DRM protected streams

Most Android devices have built-in support for Widevine DRM and don't require any additional binaries. You can see if your Android device supports Widevine DRM using the [DRM Info](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidfung.drminfo) app available in Play Store.
